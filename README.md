# personal-porfolio

The idea is to create a digital space where people can share his previous work via a link to it, photos or anything else.

## Developers guide:

To run the app localy in your machine, you should create a env.local file, with all the global variables specifies on the env.local.example file.

Also we recomend to use VSCode with ESLint and Prettier pluggins installed to follow along with our airbnb coding patterns.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Local enviroment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
